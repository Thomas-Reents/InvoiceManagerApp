# Invoice Manager App

This is a simple invoice management app built with Microsoft ASP.NET

## Description

This app allows accountants to create invoices and have them approved or rejected by a manager. There are three account types, Admin, Manager, and accountant, which is the default type. Accountants can Read, Create, Edit, and delete their own invoices. The manager can read all invoices and either approve or reject a given invoice. The admin has the power to perform all these operations. 

## Getting Started

For demoing purposes, a manager account and an admin account are seeded in the application. Their usernames and passwords are as follows:
Manager
	Username: manager@demo.com
	Password: Test@1234
Admin
	Username: admin@demo.com
	Password: Test@1234
